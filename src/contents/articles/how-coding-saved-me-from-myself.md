Hacking seems like something out of a movie- A hoodie, A computer screen and a hacker on a dark room, monitor filled with green text… So cool, right? In movies, something like this happens:

hacker=>black screen with green font=>type furiously with any keys on keyboard=> Press Caps 3 times for access granted/alt 3 times for access denied.

Hacking is just understanding how systems work, figuring out vulnerabilities, and sometimes exploiting them (ethically, of course). virtual machines are life savers. They let you run different operating systems on your computer. I am very much of a beginner in this field, and finding out about virtual maachines? The best feeling yet in my entire life. I’ve got Ubuntu running on my Windows laptop through VirtualBox. This way, I can mess around with Linux commands without worrying about breaking my actual system. If something goes wrong? Boom, just reset the VM.

Now, Linux. If you’re interested in hacking or networking,use Linux. Commands like ls, cd, and sudo will be your home- XD

Then, there’s networking, which kind of connects everything. Once you start wrapping your head around stuff like IP addresses, subnets, and how data actually moves across networks, it’s like a lightbulb moment. You start to see how the internet works and how all these devices are talking to each other. It’s kind of wild, but also really cool when it clicks. You’ll realize it’s all about understanding the flow of data, and once you get that, everything else starts to make a lot more sense. I’m still figuring it out, but it feels like I’m getting closer to cracking the code. Hacking isn’t magic, like you see in the movies. It takes a lot of effort. It’s practice, patience, and lots of googling
