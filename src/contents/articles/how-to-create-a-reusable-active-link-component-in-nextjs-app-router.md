Hey, I’m Yaduuuu 👋
If there’s one thing I’ve learned in engineering, it’s that curiosity can take you places textbooks never will. I started my Computer Science journey like everyone else—C programming assignments, random debugging headaches, and the occasional “why did I even choose this branch?” moment. But somewhere between writing my first Hello World and training my first ML model, I realized I wanted to build stuff that matters.

Fast forward to now—I’m deep into machine learning, computer vision, and projects that blur the line between tech and real-world impact.

Building for Smart Cities
One of the coolest things I’ve worked on is Shuchithwa Eye, a smart surveillance and waste detection system. Imagine a city where cameras don’t just see but understand—spotting people throwing garbage in public spaces, tracking waste accumulation, and helping municipal teams clean up faster.

I used YOLOv8 for object detection, MediaPipe for pose estimation, and hooked it all up to a MongoDB-powered dashboard. Seeing it work in real-time for the first time was a chef’s kiss moment.

We’re even taking this project to the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC), Trivandrum soon—actual smart city stuff, not just classroom theory.

Learning (and Failing) My Way Through AI
ML isn’t magic. It’s hours of tweaking hyperparameters, wondering why your model refuses to hit 90% accuracy, and questioning your life choices at 2 AM. But every failure taught me something.

Workshops like the one at IIIT Kottayam on advanced computer vision pushed me to experiment more—detecting human poses, improving tracking accuracy, and optimizing models for real-time performance.

Right now, I’m obsessed with improving pose detection for behavioral analysis—like detecting illegal dumping actions based on how a person moves. It’s frustrating, but it’s also the kind of problem that keeps me glued to my laptop.

Hackathons, IEDC, and the Community
Tech isn’t just about coding alone in a dark room (though, let’s be honest, that happens a lot). Being the IEDC Campus Lead has been a big part of my journey—organizing hackathons, building a stronger innovation culture across colleges, and meeting people who are just as crazy about tech as I am.

I love how hackathons force you to think fast, build faster, and sometimes fail spectacularly in 24 hours. It’s the best kind of learning.

What’s Next?
Short answer: a lot.

I’m aiming for a top-tier internship by 2026, diving deeper into AI for urban tech, and (fingers crossed) heading to MIT or an Ivy League school for my master’s.

But honestly? I just want to keep building things that make me go, “Whoa, I actually made this!”

So, Why Am I Sharing This?
Because if you’re an engineering student reading this, stuck in yet another boring theory lecture, here’s the truth—your coolest projects won’t come from class; they’ll come from chasing your own curiosity. Build that random idea. Break stuff. Fix it. And someday, you’ll look back and realize you’ve built something worth sharing too.
