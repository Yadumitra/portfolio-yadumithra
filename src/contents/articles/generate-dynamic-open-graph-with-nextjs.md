Manual attendance is boring, prone to errors, and let's be honest—super outdated. But with Python and OpenCV, you can build a face recognition attendance system that records entries automatically in real time. Whether you're running a classroom, office, or event, this project will save you a ton of time.

Why Face Recognition for Attendance?
Face recognition systems are not just for security cameras anymore. With libraries like OpenCV and face_recognition, you can:
✅ Automate attendance tracking
✅ Reduce fraud (no buddy-punching or proxy attendance)
✅ Store attendance data digitally in a CSV or database

Pretty neat, right?

What We’re Building
We’ll create a Python app that:

Captures video from your webcam

Detects faces and recognizes known individuals

Marks attendance in a CSV file with timestamps

Here’s how to build it.

Step 1: Install the Required Libraries
Fire up your terminal and install the following dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install opencv-python
pip install face_recognition
pip install numpy pandas
opencv-python → For video capture and basic image processing

face_recognition → For facial detection and encoding

pandas → For handling attendance logs

Step 2: Prepare Your Dataset
Create a folder called images/ and add photos of all the people you want to recognize.

Example structure:

Copy
Edit
images/
│── John.jpg
│── Alice.jpg
│── Sarah.jpg
Use clear, front-facing photos for better accuracy.

Step 3: Encode Known Faces
Let’s encode the faces so the system can recognize them later:

python
Copy
Edit
import cv2
import face_recognition
import os

path = 'images'
images = []
classNames = []

for img_name in os.listdir(path):
    img = cv2.imread(f'{path}/{img_name}')
    images.append(img)
    classNames.append(os.path.splitext(img_name)[0])

def encode_faces(images):
    encoded_list = []
    for img in images:
        rgb_img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(rgb_img)[0]
        encoded_list.append(encodings)
    return encoded_list

known_encodings = encode_faces(images)
print("Encoding Complete!")
Step 4: Real-Time Face Recognition
Now, let’s activate the webcam and start recognizing faces:

python
Copy
Edit
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime

attendance = pd.DataFrame(columns=["Name", "Time"])

def mark_attendance(name):
    global attendance
    if name not in attendance['Name'].values:
        now = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")
        attendance = pd.concat([attendance, pd.DataFrame([[name, now]], columns=["Name", "Time"])])
        attendance.to_csv("Attendance.csv", index=False)

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    success, img = cap.read()
    rgb_img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    faces = face_recognition.face_locations(rgb_img)
    encodings = face_recognition.face_encodings(rgb_img, faces)

    for encoding, face_loc in zip(encodings, faces):
        matches = face_recognition.compare_faces(known_encodings, encoding)
        face_dist = face_recognition.face_distance(known_encodings, encoding)
        match_index = np.argmin(face_dist)

        if matches[match_index]:
            name = classNames[match_index]
            y1, x2, y2, x1 = face_loc
            cv2.rectangle(img, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2)
            cv2.putText(img, name, (x1, y1-10), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (255, 255, 255), 2)
            mark_attendance(name)

    cv2.imshow('Attendance System', img)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Step 5: Test It!
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python attendance.py
Stand in front of your webcam, and voilà! Your name should appear on the screen, and your attendance gets logged into Attendance.csv.

Final Thoughts
Congratulations! You’ve built a real-time face recognition attendance system.

✅ Upgrades to try next:

Store attendance in a database instead of CSV

Integrate with a web dashboard

Send notifications when someone arrives

AI + Python = endless automation possibilities.
